  <h1>Bonfire: Sum All Primes</h1>

  <p>Sum all the prime numbers up to and including the provided number. A prime number is defined as having only two divisors, 1 and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2. 1 isn't a prime number, because it's only
    divisible by itself. The provided number may not be a prime.</p>
