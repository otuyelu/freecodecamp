Script:     Random Quote

Functions:  This simple script allows you to print random
            quotations in the page.  Any number of quotes
            may be used.

Browsers:   All

Author:     etLux
============================================================

INSTRUCTIONS:

Put the following script in the <body> of your page,
wherever you want the quotes to appear.  Simply set up the
quotations in the Quotations[] array, then paste in the
whole block of code.  To format the text, wrap the usual
font tags around the script (view source on our demo on this
page for an example.)

TECH NOTE:

In quotation 8, note the text, \"beauty\" -- if you need
to use double-quote " marks, you *must* precede each
double-quote with a backslash \... otherwise the script
will break.

var Quotation=new Array() // do not change this!

// Set up the quotations to be shown, below.
// To add more quotations, continue with the
// pattern, adding to the array.  Remember
// to increment the Quotation[x] index!

Quotation[0] = "Time is of the essence! Comb your hair.";
Quotation[1] = "Sanity is a golden apple with no shoelaces.";
Quotation[2] = "Repent! The end is coming, $9.95 at Amazon.";
Quotation[3] = "Honesty blurts where deception sneezes.";
Quotation[4] = "Pastry satisfies where art is unavailable.";
Quotation[5] = "Delete not, lest you, too, be deleted.";
Quotation[6] = "O! Youth! What a pain in the backside.";
Quotation[7] = "Wishes are like goldfish with propellors.";
Quotation[8] = "Love the river's \"beauty\", but live on a hill.";
Quotation[9] = "Invention is the mother of too many useless toys.";

var Q = Quotation.length;
var whichQuotation=Math.round(Math.random()*(Q-1));
